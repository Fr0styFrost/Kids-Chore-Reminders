# Kids-Chore-Reminders
I would like to make a program to help my kids with their chore list and offer them incentives. 
The idea is to send a daily reminder about a chore with a value to be added to their pocket money if accepted & completed. I would like this program to run on a centrel machine to easy add or remove tasks but also not be reliant on the machine to be online to send reminders or new task lists.

Implementation
Backend Server:
I'll use Python along with a web framework like Flask or Django to create a simple backend server. This server will be responsible for managing chore lists, incentives, and handling requests from my script and potentially a web-based interface for managing tasks.

Database:
I'll use a lightweight database like SQLite or a more robust option like PostgreSQL to store information about chores, incentives, and user data.

API Endpoints:
I'll implement API endpoints for tasks such as adding/removing tasks, updating task details, and querying the task list. I'll make sure to secure these endpoints with authentication to prevent unauthorized access.

Task Scheduler:
I'll use a task scheduler library (e.g., Celery) to schedule reminders and task updates. This ensures that the reminders are sent even if the central machine is not actively running my script.

Reminder Script:
I'll use Python as it's a good choice for creating a script to send reminders. I can use a library like smtplib for sending emails or a messaging service API for sending messages.

Scheduled Execution:
I'll use a system scheduler (e.g., cron on Unix/Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows) to periodically run my Python script. This way, even if the central machine is not online all the time, the script can run when the machine is active.

Notification Method:
I'll choose a notification method that works best for my kids. It could be email, text messages, or even a custom messaging app if I want to get creative.

Integration with Backend:
My script should make API requests to the backend server to fetch the latest task list and incentives. I'll ensure that the script handles any errors or exceptions gracefully.

Additional Considerations:
User Interface: I can create a simple web-based interface using a framework like Flask or Django to add or remove tasks manually. This would allow me to manage tasks without directly interacting with the database.

Security:
I'll implement secure communication between the script and the backend server. I'll use HTTPS for API requests and ensure proper authentication mechanisms are in place.
